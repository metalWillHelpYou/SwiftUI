# SwiftUI
### These are some of my **SwiftUI** projects.

The first UI is a famous game that I'm sure every one of you has played.  
Fight with a simple AI and try to beat him.

Second UI is an abstract food ordering application. User can choose meals he likes and add them to the wishlist. Further, if desired, he can enter number of his loyalty card and pay a tip. At the end, he will see a screen with the total amount and gratitude.

Third UI is a copy of the application for ordering a taxi. Of course, you cannot order real taxis, but you can find places of interest to you and see how much you would pay for the trip.
